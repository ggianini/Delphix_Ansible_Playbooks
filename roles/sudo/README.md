# üëë Sudo Access Role

Welcome to the "Sudo Access" role documentation! This role is responsible for providing specific command access to the user 'delphix_os' to execute necessary operations on the hosts. Let's delve into how this role facilitates granting the right permissions.

## üåü Role Overview

The "Sudo Access" role is designed to empower the 'delphix_os' user with selective command execution privileges. It ensures the user can perform essential operations without entering a password.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Role Variables

The role includes variables that determine the commands the 'delphix_os' user can execute without requiring a password.

- `commands`: A list of commands that 'delphix_os' can run with escalated privileges.

You can customize this list of commands to match the necessary operations.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Include the Role**: In your playbook, include the `sudo` role.

2. **Customize Variables**: If needed, modify the `commands` variable in your playbook or in the `defaults/main.yml` file.

3. **Run the Playbook**: Execute your playbook to grant 'delphix_os' the specified command access.

```yaml
# Example playbook usage
- name: Playbook to Configure Sudo Access
  hosts: your_target_hosts
  roles:
    - sudo
```

## üìù Example Playbook

Here's a quick example playbook snippet:

```yaml
- name: Configure Sudo Access for Delphix
  hosts: delphix_hosts
  roles:
    - sudo
```

## üîë Important Notes

Granting sudo access should be done carefully and only for the necessary commands. Always ensure that the provided commands align with your security policies.

Feel free to explore this role's tasks in the `tasks/main.yml` file for an in-depth look at the permissions being granted.

## üìñ Always Refer to Delphix Documentation

For updates, specific requirements, and customization according to different Delphix versions, it's recommended to refer to the official Delphix documentation at [docs.delphix.com](https://docs.delphix.com).
