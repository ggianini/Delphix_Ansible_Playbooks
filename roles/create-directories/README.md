# 📁 Create Directories Role

Welcome to the "Create Directories" role documentation! This role is a crucial piece of the puzzle for a successful Delphix setup. It's responsible for creating essential directories that lay the foundation for smooth operations. Let's dive in and explore its functionalities.

## 📂 Directories Created

This role creates two important directories:

### 🧰 Toolkit Storage Directory

The toolkit storage is where the magic happens. It houses automation scripts, backup, provisioning, and instance management tools. Even the logs from automation plugins (e.g., Postgres plugin) call this place home.

### 📁 Virtual Database Mountpoint

Imagine it as a home for your virtual databases (VDBs). The mountpoint is where an NFS mount will be created to accommodate the virtual database files generated by Delphix.

## ⚙️ Role Variables

To configure this role, you have access to the following default variables:

- `default_mount_path`: The default mount path for the virtual database mountpoint.
- `default_delphix_os`: The default Delphix user for the operating system.
- `default_toolkit_path`: The default toolkit storage path.

You can customize these variables based on your environment's needs.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Include the Role**: In your playbook, include the `create-directories` role.

2. **Customize Variables**: If needed, modify the role variables in your playbook or in the `defaults/main.yml` file.

3. **Run the Playbook**: Execute your playbook to create the necessary directories.

```yaml
# Example playbook usage
- name: Playbook to Set Up Directories
  hosts: your_target_hosts
  roles:
    - create-directories
```

## 📝 Example Playbook

Here's a quick example playbook snippet:

```yaml
- name: Set Up Directories for Delphix
  hosts: delphix_hosts
  roles:
    - create-directories
```

## ✔️ Compatibility

This role is compatible with both Red Hat-like and Ubuntu-like operating systems.

## 🔑 Important Notes

Remember, these directories are vital for a smooth Delphix setup. And this playbook will ensure proper permissions, ownership, and space availability for optimal performance.

Feel free to explore this role's tasks in the `tasks/main.yml` file for an in-depth look at the actions being taken.

Happy automating and sailing the seas of Delphix!
